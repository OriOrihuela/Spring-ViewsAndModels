# Spring-ViewsAndModels
## An exercise about the MVC design pattern with Spring and Thymeleaf.
This unit covers the Vista component of the MVC pattern. It is about adding HTML structure and CSS presentation to the data that the 
controllers send to the client (the browser). We will see Thymeleaf, a language that performs more or less the functions of Angular 
(and other frameworks of the style).

### Thymeleaf
An HTML language with Angular style added logic, powered by the Balearic Islands ;).

### MVC model of Spring
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.1.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-modelattrib-methods

This document explains the Spring MVC model ...

... and also the `@ModelAttribute` annotation that can be used to populate the `Model` with data and read the values of its attributes. 
The database can also be accessed.

The statement -which is included in a text file of the practice- reads as follows:
